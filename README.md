# BlogNoFrameworkMVC
Create MVC blog without using any PHP Framework or CMS.

I created this project as a test task for Check24 in 2017
This project is interecting since it explaince the architecture from scratch -- we use no Framework and no CMS.


what can be improved in the future:
* use namespaces
* use interfaces
* Add ORM since I use hardcoded mySQL commands
* Use databse Migrations
* What else?
